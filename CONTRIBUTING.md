# Contributing

This is an experimental bootstrap project. Read the
[plan](docs/PLAN.md), [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[source policy](docs/PROVENANCE.md) before adding a subsystem.

## A useful change

- Addresses a bounded milestone requirement.
- States what is implemented and what remains unsupported.
- Includes the smallest relevant host/image/simulator tests.
- Records hardware evidence separately when hardware behavior changes.
- Preserves per-file licenses and contains no private data.

Do not add a success-returning radio, security, persistence or join stub to
make an example look functional. Add an explicit unsupported boundary only
when it has a real caller and a tested failure contract.

## Specialist Copilot agents

Two repository-local [Copilot custom agent profiles](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/custom-agents-configuration)
are provided; no global installation or fixed model is required.

| Agent | Intended task |
| --- | --- |
| [zigbee-stack](.github/agents/zigbee-stack.agent.md) | Protocol codecs/state machines, specification lookup, end-device conformance and security/commissioning boundaries |
| [cc2530-platform](.github/agents/cc2530-platform.agent.md) | CC2530/SDCC, memory and linker ABI, debugger transport and isolated chip services |

In Copilot CLI opened at this repository, use `/agent` to select a profile,
or name it in a prompt, for example: "Use zigbee-stack to implement the
assigned offline MAC codec extension." A new CLI invocation can select it
with `copilot --agent=cc2530-platform`.

Give a delegated task a bounded objective, file ownership and required
evidence. Coordinate shared interfaces in the main task; do not run two
writers over the same files. The profiles allow read/search/edit/execute/web
tools, omit nested-agent tools, and inherit the configured model. Ordinary CLI
permissions still apply: profile instructions are not an OS sandbox, and
shell access does not constitute authorization to operate hardware.

The Zigbee profile consults the external
[reviewed reference index](docs/PROVENANCE.md#specialist-agent-reference)
on demand. It does not install that repository's agent/skill or copy its
catalog here. Reference retrieval needs network access, but firmware builds
and offline tests do not depend on that repository. Neither profile adds
working firmware features or changes the project's support claims.

## Development checks

With SDCC 4.2.0, `s51`, Python 3.9 or newer, GNU Make and a host C compiler on `PATH`:

```sh
make BOARD=generic all test
make BOARD=lg_esl29_rev03 all test
make BOARD=generic IMAGE=debug_fixture all test
make BOARD=lg_esl29_rev03 IMAGE=debug_fixture all test
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_*.py' -v
python3 tools/check_repository.py
git diff --check
```

The build writes to `build/`. Generated firmware, captures and logs must not
be committed. Do not add a dependency solely to avoid a small standard-library
check; new dependencies need a purpose and license review.

The M1 transport tests use synthetic USB backends and must never enumerate
hardware. Ordinary tests need no PyUSB; optional PyUSB resource-manager tests
are explicitly skipped when it is absent. To include those tests without any
USB device access, use a virtual environment:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-debug.txt
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_m1_*.py' -v
```

On Ubuntu, creating this environment may require `python3-venv`. Actual
device access is a separate manual activity described in
[DEBUGGING.md](docs/DEBUGGING.md#implemented-host-transport).

During offline M1 work, do not run even USB enumeration or adapter-state
commands against physical devices. `tools/debug_image.py` and all tests above
operate without an adapter. New control commands need explicit permissions,
pre/post-state checks, one bounded operation deadline, and tests proving that
an error cannot trigger a retry or an implicit resume/reset.
`reset-halt` and `attach-reset` are hardware commands despite their host-tested
implementations: never invoke them in these checks. Reset permission is
independent of ordinary CPU-control permission. Initial attach needs its
distinct explicit access policy and must not be substituted for ordinary
open or an existing-session read. Offline source-location tests must not open
paths named by CDB data.

The same `make ... all test` commands also run the standalone MAC codec on
host and in `mac_frame_test.ihx` under alias-aware simulation. That executable
is test-only: do not flash it, add it to firmware support claims or upload it
as a board image. Protocol codecs must reject unsupported security/layouts
explicitly and must not equate syntactic decoding with authenticated input.

## Code conventions

- C99, fixed-width integers and explicit bounds.
- Four-space C indentation; tabs for Make recipes.
- Keep compiler-specific SFR/pointer/interrupt details in platform code.
- Avoid heap allocation, packed-struct wire serialization and unbounded waits.
- Keep ISR work small and audit SDCC reentrancy/stack implications.
- Errors must carry a reason and a defined recovery/state transition.
- Comment hardware/ABI subtleties, not obvious assignments.

## Hardware and reviews

No CI job or ordinary build target may flash hardware or transmit RF.
Manual hardware work requires a confirmed board/image, recovery backups and
an appropriate test setup. A software-only change is not permission to erase
a connected device.

For protocol work, identify the specification revision and relevant sections.
For a footprint claim, identify code/XDATA/IRAM separately. For a compatibility
claim, provide the actual scenario and coordinator versions.
