# Sources, licensing and public-data policy

## Original work

Original project code and documentation are BSD-3-Clause. Hardware register
addresses, protocol field definitions and other functional facts are not an
excuse to copy an implementation whose license has not been checked.

At M0, no third-party radio or Zigbee stack implementation is vendored.
Standard compiler/runtime dependencies retain their own upstream licenses.
BSD-3-Clause does not relicense SDCC, its runtime, uCsim, or external tools.

The M1 debugger fixture and its test patterns are original BSD-3-Clause work.
Its MOV/NOP/RET probe uses ordinary 8051 instructions and synthetic constants,
not bytes from an OEM image or an external programmer/debugger implementation.
No USB backend, programmer code or additional dependency is imported by it.

### M1 host transport sources

The original BSD-3-Clause host transport uses **functional wire facts only**
from the public `dashesy/cc-tool` revision
`0d84df329e343e2ea5a960c04a3d4478ee039aa0`. The inspected files declare GNU
GPL v2. No implementation, instruction macro sequences, fixtures or notices
from that programmer are copied into this project:

| Public reference | Facts used |
| --- | --- |
| [cc_programmer.cpp](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/0d84df329e343e2ea5a960c04a3d4478ee039aa0/src/programmer/cc_programmer.cpp) | CC Debugger USB `0451:16A2`, configuration 1/interface 0, bulk OUT `04` / IN `84`; vendor IN `GET_STATE` request `C0`, value/index zero, 8-byte response with three little-endian 16-bit fields at offsets 0/2/4 |
| [cc_unit_driver.cpp](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/0d84df329e343e2ea5a960c04a3d4478ee039aa0/src/programmer/cc_unit_driver.cpp) and [cc_debug_interface.h](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/0d84df329e343e2ea5a960c04a3d4478ee039aa0/src/programmer/cc_debug_interface.h) | Bulk diagnostic requests `1F 34` (read status), `1F 24` (read config), each followed by one input byte |
| [cc_253x_254x.cpp](https://github.com/dashesy/cc-tool/blob/0d84df329e343e2ea5a960c04a3d4478ee039aa0/src/programmer/cc_253x_254x.cpp) | Adapter target-family ID `2530` for CC2530; not a unique device identity |

These are public implementation references, **not an official TI USB protocol
specification or hardware verification**. No generalized USB debug-bytecode
encoder or programmer sequence is inferred from them. SWRU191F chapter 3
describes the target debug interface; it must not be mistaken for this USB
adapter's framing specification.

For the CPU-control addition, TI **SWRU191F** was checked directly:
Table 3-1 pp.53-54 (HALT/RESUME/STEP_INSTR/GET_BM and their results),
Table 3-2 p.55 (CC2530 debug configuration), Table 3-3 pp.55-56
(status/oscillator requirements), section 3.3.3 pp.56-57 (three breakpoint
parameter bytes) and section 3.4.1 p.57 (commands allowed when debug-locked).
HALT `44`, RESUME `4C`, STEP_INSTR `5C` and GET_BM `64` are zero-argument,
one-response-byte target commands; their three low opcode bits are don't-care
for these commands. The existing `1F` USB shape is reused for this bounded
class. Actual adapter behavior remains an explicit hardware acceptance gate.
No two-byte-response or debug-instruction USB framing is inferred or shipped.

The same pinned `cc_unit_driver.cpp`, `reset(bool)`, supplies the reset wire
facts: vendor OUT request type `40`, request `C9`, value `0`, index `1` for
debug mode and an empty data stage. Index `0` requests normal execution and
is deliberately not exposed. Our implementation checks explicit reset
permission, a prepared existing session, pre/post status and exact USB
completion; it does not copy the reference's reset-on-close behavior.
The pinned `cc_programmer.cpp`, `enter_debug_mode()` and
`request_device_info()`, additionally supply initial adapter preparation
facts, implemented as a separately authorized operation:

| Vendor OUT request | Value / index | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `C5` | `0` / `0` | Empty |
| `C8` | `1` / `0` | 48 bytes initially filled with ASCII spaces; `CC2530` at offset 0, `DID:` at offset 16, four uppercase hex digits of USB descriptor `bcdDevice` at offset 21 |
| `C9` | `0` / `1` | Empty; request reset into debug mode |

`bcdDevice` is the cached USB device revision, not a serial number, factory
identity, `GET_STATE` firmware version or firmware revision. We do not copy
the reference's automatic configuration changes, debug-config writes,
normal-execution reset or programmer algorithms. The implementation requires
exact completion counts and fresh halted/awake status, not the reference's
broader programmer workflow. These are reviewed functional facts and
host-tested compositions, not observed behavior of an actual adapter.
Generalized multi-byte target-command USB framing remains unconfirmed.

The breakpoint codec encodes only the target's documented slot/enable/bank
and CODE address fields, not adapter bytecode. All vectors are original
synthetic data. The manual is linked, not redistributed.

Offline symbol lookup reads this project's own SDCC 4.2.0 map/CDB output and
build hashes. Its supported record subset is checked against genuine linked
images and original synthetic records, not imported debugger code. Source
lookup uses the linked `L:C$file$line$scope$block:address` records emitted by
this toolchain. Scope/block identifiers are retained, not used to infer
function ranges, instruction lengths or source stepping. No source text is
imported or resolved from CDB filenames. Snapshot decoders use the project's
documented M0/M1 ABIs, not captured device data.

The optional dependency in `requirements-debug.txt` is
[PyUSB 1.3.1](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/tree/89ea84d6c9e4cb81bc6e40d7df849d0cbd7dfd47),
BSD-3-Clause, reviewed via its
[license](https://github.com/pyusb/pyusb/blob/89ea84d6c9e4cb81bc6e40d7df849d0cbd7dfd47/LICENSE)
and public API. It is installed externally, not vendored. The backend uses
public methods; optional host tests exercise its pinned resource manager to
check that explicit release errors are not lost during disposal. The system
[libusb runtime](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/blob/v1.0.27/COPYING) retains
its LGPL-2.1 license; it is neither embedded in firmware nor redistributed
by this repository. Synthetic backend responses contain no real device data.

Contiki's RF code depends on Contiki facilities. An adaptation must replace
those interfaces deliberately, preserve the original notices and be tested
against the CC2530 documentation. It does not supply Zigbee NWK/APS/ZDO.

The inspected legacy ZBOSS tree documents TI CC253x use with IAR and an SDCC
simulator configuration. The presence of both words in one repository is not
proof of a tested native CC2530/SDCC port. Its old protocol implementation is
not automatically compliant with the project's intended R22/BDB behavior.

## Normative target

Engineering references:

- Zigbee Core R22, document **05-3474-22**.
- A Zigbee-3.0-era BDB revision compatible with R22. This is an explicit
  [open gate in the initial conformance ledger](CONFORMANCE.md), to be resolved
  before M4/M5 security/commissioning implementation, not after interoperability
  work. Exact procedures and requirements must be recorded.
- Applicable Zigbee Cluster Library and application-profile requirements for
  the chosen device, pinned when those layers are implemented.

BDB 3.1, document 22-65816-030, belongs with R23/PRO 2023. It may inform future
work but must not be cited as an R22 requirement. The project is not certified.

Key R22 references used in the plan: Table 2-44 p.84; section 2.4.4.1 p.137;
section 2.4.4.4.5 p.188; section 2.5.4.8.1 p.222;
section 3.6.10.2 pp.392-393; section 4.3.4 pp.416-417.
Paraphrases in this repository are an engineering aid, not replacement
specification text.

## Before importing any code or data

Record its upstream URL and immutable revision, license, original notices,
local changes and tests. Check each imported dependency, not merely the
repository's top-level license badge.

- Do not vendor proprietary IAR/TI stack libraries or OEM firmware code.
- Do not assume IAR-built objects can be linked by SDCC.
- Do not copy GPL programmer/debugger implementation into the BSD core.
  A separately licensed tool or an external dependency is a different decision
  and needs explicit documentation.
- Do not import raw device dumps, private traffic captures, real credentials,
  factory identities or personal photographs.
- Use synthetic/publicly licensed test fixtures with a documented origin.
- Review and sanitize a new media/fixture policy before adding binary assets.

The lightweight repository checker is a guardrail, not a complete secret
scanner, legal review or proof of provenance. Human review is still required
before publication.
